			<h3>why choose meowtime? 🐱</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>🎯 <a href="https://github.com/sbeltranc/meowtime" target="_blank">it's open source!</a> you're able to check my terrible code for this service</li>
				<li>📊 know if you're productive or just really good at looking busy</li>
				<li>🕒 still tracks time on how much time u have spent on ur project</li>
				<li>💝 it's pretty swag and awesome for people who love data</li>
				<li>🧠 because "I think I spent 51 hours on a hello world" is not a valid metric</li>
				<li>🚀 u can find where u got stuck at for the past 12 hours on your project</li>
